<h1>
Assignment #3</h1>
<b>Due</b>: Thurs, Feb 15

<h2>Objective</h2>

This assignment will involve practice with characters and strings, using 
the libraries discussed in class (String, StringBuilder, Character), as 
well as basic File I/O (with text files).

<h2>Task</h2>
Write a program in a class called <tt>WebToPigLatin</tt> (filename 
<tt>WebToPigLatin.java</tt>) that will translate web page content (html 
files) to Pig Latin versions of the page.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>1) Command structure</h3>

The program should take its input information through two command line 
parameters.  The usage format is:
<pre>
  java WebToPigLatin <i>inputFile</i> <i>outputFile</i>
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
  java WebToPigLatin page1.html pigpage1.html
</pre>
In the above example, the input page is <tt>page1.html</tt>.  The 
results should be written to the file <tt>pigpage1.html</tt>.

<p>If the command to the program is given incorrectly, print out a usage 
message like:
<pre>
  Usage: java WebToPigLatin inputFile outputFile
  Must have two command-line parameters
</pre>
and abort.

<h3>2) Pig-Latin rules</h3>

For our purposes, we will use the following as the rules for 
translation of a word into "Pig Latin":
 
<ol>
<li>A <b>word</b> to be translated is a consecutive sequence of letters 
(a-z, A-Z) or apostrophes, containing at least one vowel (or y in a 
vowel position). Examples: <tt>Zebra , doesn't , apple, 
rhythm</tt></li>

<li>If a word starts with a vowel, the Pig Latin version is the original
word with "way" added to the end</li>

<li>If a word starts with a consonant, or a series of consecutive
consonants, the Pig Latin version transfers all consonants up to the first
vowel to the <b>end</b> of the word, and adds "ay" to the end.</li>

<li>The letter 'y' should be treated as a consonant if it is the first
letter of a word, but treated as a vowel otherwise.</li>

<li>If the original word is capitalized, the new Pig Latin version of the 
word should be capitalized in the first letter (i.e. the previous capital 
letter may not be capitalized any more).</li>

</ol>

</li>

Examples of pig latin translations of words, under these rules:
<br>&nbsp;

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=5 >
<tr><th>Word</th><th>PigLatin version</th></tr>

<tr><td>Flower</td><td>Owerflay</td></tr>
<tr><td>yellow</td><td>ellowyay</td></tr>
<tr><td>bypass</td><td>ypassbay</td></tr>
<tr><td>apple</td><td>appleway</td></tr>
<tr><td>Igloo</td><td>Iglooway</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>ingstray</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hamburger</td><td>Amburgerhay</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rhythm</td><td>Ythmrhay</td></tr>
<tr><td>queen</td><td>ueenqay</td></tr>
<tr><td>zippity</td><td>ippityzay</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>3) File handling rules</h3>

For the purposes of translating only the CONTENT of an html file (i.e. a 
web page), please observe the following requirements:

<ol> 
<li>Anything that appears inside of html tags is not content, so it 
should not be converted.  Example:
<pre>
  &lt;font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yadda Yadda&lt;/font>
</pre>
In this tag, only "Yadda Yadda" is content. The rest is not translated.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li>Any item that fits the pattern of <tt>&amp;<i>text</i>;</tt> is not 
content. These are special html markers for placing symbols like quotes 
and ampersands, that otherwise have special meaning to browsers.  
Example:
<pre>
  &amp;nbsp;Hello there		// only "Hello there" is content
  &amp;quote;Hello there&amp;quote;	// only "Hello there" is content
</pre>
</li>

<li>Do not consider punctuation (other than apostrophes) to be parts of 
words (i.e. 
they should not be part of word translations).  Punctuation will still 
appear in the content in the appropriate places, after translation.  
Example:
<pre>
   The attentive, brilliant Java student's friend was happy.
</pre>
translates to
<pre>
   Ethay attentiveway, illiantbray Avajay udent'sstay iendfray asway appyhay.
</pre>
</li>

<li>Numbers on web pages are obviously not translatable, so leave them 
as-is.<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li>Abbreviations with no vowels in them are not translatable, so leave 
them as-is.<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li>Anything from the html file that is not translated to Pig Latin 
should still appear in the file as-is. i.e. the intent is that the 
resulting web page should still appear the same as the original, simply 
with all of the content words converted to Pig Latin.
</li>


</ol>

<h2>General Requirements and Hints</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your code should be readable and well-documented</li>
<li>You may make use of any of the features of the <tt>String</tt>, 
<tt>StringBuilder</tt> and <tt>Character</tt> class libraries.  Each of 
these is in the <tt>java.lang</tt> package.</li>
<li>For File I/O, recommended libraries are:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>java.util.Scanner</tt></li>
  <li><tt>java.io.FileReader</tt> -- for reading single characters at a time</li>
  <li><tt>java.io.FileWriter</tt></li>
  <li><tt>java.util.Formatter</tt></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Pack your program into a <i>runnable</i> jar file called 
<tt>hw3.jar</tt> for submitting.</li>

</ul>
